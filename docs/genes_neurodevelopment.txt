The goal is to understand how gene expression changes across different brain regions.
So it would make sense to choose genes that are known to be involved in neurodevelopment and maturation. 
Namely (taken from outside resrouces):

PAX6: Known as the master control gene for the development of eyes and sensory organs, including certain parts of the brain. It also plays a role in the neurogenesis of the cerebral cortex.

NOS2: Produces nitric oxide, a reactive free radical which acts as a biologic mediator in several processes, including neurotransmission and antimicrobial and antitumoral activities.

SYN1: This gene is a member of the synapsin gene family. Synapsins encode neuronal phosphoproteins which associate with the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles. It's implicated in synaptogenesis and the modulation of neurotransmitter release, suggesting an important role in several neuropsychiatric diseases.

CDKL5: Mutations in this gene are associated with a severe neurodevelopmental disorder known as CDKL5 deficiency disorder, characterized by early-onset seizures, severe intellectual disability, and developmental delay.

CACNA1G, CACNA2D2: They are members of the calcium channel gene family. Calcium channels play a critical role in neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction, and cell excitability. They are implicated in a variety of neurological disorders.

ARX: ARX plays a pivotal role in brain development and is involved in a range of disorders of sexual development.

DVL2: It is a part of the Wnt signaling pathway, which has been implicated in neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative diseases.
